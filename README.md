# Building-ETL-Pipeline
The ETL Pipeline Project focuses on designing and implementing a robust Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) system for automating the flow of data from various sources into a target data warehouse or database for analysis and reporting.

You can think of pipelines as transport tubes in a mailroom. Mail can be placed in specific tubes and sucked up to specific processing centers. Based on specific labels, the mail is then moved and sorted into specific pathways that eventually bring it to its destination. The core concept of data pipelines is quite similar. Like mail, packets of raw data are ingested into the entry of the pipeline and, through a series of steps and processes, the raw material is formatted and packaged into an output location, which is most commonly used for storage.

From a business perspective, the driving incentive for creating data pipelines is to design a system to transform their most valuable asset – raw data – into actionable information (Reference #2). Typically, data pipeline architectures feature a unidirectional (one-way) communication flow between the flow of input data sources to output data storage systems (Reference #1):
